# Pulley Cipher -Assignment

This serves as a solution to Pulley's initial Coding Assignment.

There is a single variable to be filled-in for the solution to be successful. I'll leave that step up to you. ðŸ˜‰

## Pre-requisites

1. **Python Installation**: Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine. This guide and the accompanying code are designed to work with Python 3.6 or newer. You can download Python from the official website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After installation, you can verify the installation by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal or command prompt.

> **Important Note**: This utilizes Python Version **3.10**

3. **Familiarity with Terminal or Command Prompt**: Basic knowledge of using the terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows) will be beneficial. You will need to use it to run the test scripts provided in the `main.py` file.

4. **Install Required Python Packages**: Before starting with the tasks, it's essential to install the Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. These packages include necessary libraries that might be used throughout the tasks in this guide. To install these packages, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

By ensuring these prerequisites are met, you will be well-prepared to engage with the tasks and make the most out of this solution for Pulley's initial Coding Assignment.
